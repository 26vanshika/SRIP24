## Roadmap
The steps that I followed for this mini-project were as follows:

I first gathered and learnt about the resources I would be needing by searching them through the internet.

It was not a one day work though the project seems small. I ran into multiple challenges which I will be mentioning below.

I first recorded the audio of breathing in mask.

Then using IPython I imported it in my jupyter notebook.

To do the analysis of the audio I used Librosa package mainly used for Sound analysis.

I learnt about the low-pass filter to filter high frequencies and coded one(I faced a lot of issues here :) ).

Then using Matplotlib and Librosa's display feature I plotted the waveform and spectogram of Original and Filtered audio.


## What I learned
So basically I had pre-requisite knowledge in Machine learning, but I learnt a lot of things 

Like I was aware of Matplotlib but wasnt aware of Librosa's waveform feature.

I also learnt how to make filters in my python(I only learnt about them in theory thanks to an Electrical Engineering course)

Also Quarto is just something I didnt know and glad through this project I learnt about it, because it really does wonders. Definetly going to use in my future projects.

## Challenges I ran into

There were a lot of challenges I ran into:

Firstly my packages were installed but were showing "module not found", fixed that with a lot of frustration.

I also faced issues with Quarto since I was completely new to it.

And a lot of errors in making the low-pass filter.

My github was also not committing changes smoothly, it was continously showing errors.
